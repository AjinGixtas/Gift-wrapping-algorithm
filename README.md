# Gift-wrapping-algorithm
A quick program visualize how the gift warpping algorithm works. Because animating the algorithm thinking process requires refactor the entire script, 
line is drawn staticly instead. The first point to the last point has the color range evenly on the color pie. Gradient fade line describe line that algorithm
evaluated and the solid line describe line that algorithm decided to pick
